## 👋 Hi, I'm Israel!

I'm a passionate developer currently studying **Software Engineering** at **Adama Science and Technology University** 🎓.
I love building fully functional websites with both a cool, responsive front end and a reliable, secure back end 🔧.

### 🚀 Tech Stack
- 💻 Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- 🛠️ Backend: Django (Python)

I enjoy working on fullstack web applications and turning ideas into real-world projects that solve problems or make life easier.
Whether it's crafting a smooth UI or setting up efficient backend logic, I'm always excited to learn and build more 💡.

### 🌱 Currently Learning
I'm always leveling up my skills — diving deeper into Django and exploring modern JavaScript frameworks to make my apps even better.

### 📫 Let's Connect!
I'm open to collaboration, feedback, or just a friendly chat. Feel free to check out my projects and follow along on my journey!
